🌾 Rice Image Classification using CNN (Deep Learning)

🛠️ Technologies Use

Python, TensorFlow / Keras, NumPy & Pandas ,Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization) ,OpenCV / PIL (for image processing) ,Streamlit (for deployment), SQL – prediction history database

The Rice Image Classification project is a Deep Learning–based Computer Vision system that classifies different types of rice grains from images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

This project demonstrates a complete end-to-end deep learning workflow, including:

Image data loading and preprocessing

Image resizing and normalization

CNN model architecture design and training

Model evaluation using accuracy and loss metrics

Saving the trained model in .h5 format

Deployment using a Streamlit web application for real-time prediction

Prediction history stored in SQL database
